# shopping-cart

This is a shopping cart UI built using React.js. You can add products to the cart, remove items and delete items. When you add or remove any product the checkout section on the bottom corner of the website automatically adjusts to the current items in the cart. The price and the final amount is adjusted dynamically using 'state management' in react.
